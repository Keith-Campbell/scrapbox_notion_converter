###  Self-introduction

=== About My Research and Background ===

I am a Ph.D. student at the Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University. My major is applied mathematics, and my research is mathematical optimization. Especially I study stochastic equilibrium problems (technically known as stochastic variational inequality and complementarity problems) which have many applications in the real world such as noncooperative game theory and traffic engineering.

My main research activity is to do mathematics but I have work experience in programming. For example, I worked for Mitsubishi Electric Corporation for two years as an embedded software engineer before entering Kyoto University.

In addition, I currently work as a freelance to develop software mainly using Python. In recent works, I have experienced implementing an image segmentation system.



### Work Experience

**SUSLAB

I develop new technologies for Society 5.0 which is the 5th science and technology basic plan proposed by the Japanese government. I have engaged in the development of image processing or generating 3D models using new machine learning technologies. Now, I develop new software for scheduling by using mathematical optimization.

**Mitsubishi Electric Corp.

I worked as an embedded software engineer especially in AUTOSAR, which is a software platform for vehicles, at Automotive Electronics Development Center in Himeji and have experienced how to learn new skills beyond my academic background which is mathematical optimization. Besides, through the work of AUTOSAR development, I learned: 1. debugging the large-scale programs, 2. not relying on intuition but logical thinking to work accurately.



### Academic Experience

**Master's degree

The link is my first article submitted in an international journal. The study is a joint work with Prof. Masao Fukushima (Professor Emeritus of Kyoto University).

**Bachelor's degree

I learned control theory and basic mathematics for optimization in freshman and sophomore, after assigned to Prof. Masao Fukushima's laboratory, I studied mathematical optimization theory, and I proposed a new algorithm for solving an equilibrium problem, called multi-leader--follower games which is an extension of Stackelberg game and was not easy to solve so far.
